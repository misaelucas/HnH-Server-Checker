"HnH Server Checker is a Python script utilizing web scraping with BeautifulSoup to monitor the real-time status of the Haven and Hearth game server from an online URL. It features an automated process that checks the server's availability at regular intervals and, upon detecting that the server is up, triggers an alarm sound ('free_alarm_stolen_from_misa.mp3') using the Pygame library. This versatile tool provides a reliable way to stay informed about the operational status of the Haven and Hearth server."
